# Toss Dummy
Application in kotlin for simple tossing of coin and deciding.
Finally I was able to implement interstitial ad in my Toss Dummy
The name of the application is now changes as the purpose of the application should be clear as suggest by friends.
After 1 week of error correction and not knowing what I was doing wrong as everything in the application was working fine, today finally my
interstitial ad was working.
This application is used for deciding any kind of doubt you are facing and can't decide what you should do, really i made this application for this simple purpose.
Although you can use it for deciding who gets to pick the first bear or who gets to keep the torphy.
And the ever green for deciding who will go first in chance.
Well this branch was created as i didn't wanted my interstitial ad implementation go to waste as, I figured out that i can't show interstitial ads in this application 
just yet.
So, I created this branch in order to keep this implementation as a record for future reference.
