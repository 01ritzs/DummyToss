# Toss Dummy
Application in kotlin for simple tossing of coin and deciding.
The name of the application is now changes as the purpose of the application should be clear as suggested by friends.
This application is used for deciding any kind of doubt, you are facing and can't decide what you should do. 
Really, I made this application just for this simple purpose.
Although you can use it for deciding who gets to pick the first bear or who gets to keep the torphy.
And then there is ever green reason for deciding who will get first chance.
In the background you will be able to see gradiant effect which is been implemented.
As mentioned above this application is written in 100% pure kotlin.
There are some addition such as localization in this application for few countries.
Banner ad is also being used in this project.
This will be in series of dummy developers as you can see in the name consist dummy as the rest of my applications.
There are more changes and addition of features in this project in near future.
